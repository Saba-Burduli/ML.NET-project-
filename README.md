This project is a simple ML.NET application that predicts the price of used cars based on:

Model
Year
Mileage
It uses a regression model trained on synthetic data for:

Dodge Challenger
Ford Mustang
BMW 3 Series
Mercedes C-Class
ML Pipeline
Load CSV training data (up to 1M rows)
One-hot encode the Model field
Normalize numeric fields: Year, Mileage
Combine features: ModelEncoded + Year + Mileage
Train using the FastTree regression algorithm
Evaluate the model and save it to disk
Dataset Sample
